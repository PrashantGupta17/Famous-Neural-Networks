Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) Examples
1. RNN for Numerical Sequence Prediction (basic-rnn-numbers.py)
Overview
This example demonstrates the implementation of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using TensorFlow and Keras for predicting the next value in a numerical sequence. The RNN is designed to learn patterns within sequences and make predictions based on historical data.

Explanation
Data Generation: Random numerical sequences are generated as input, and the target output is the sum of values along the sequence.
Model Architecture: A simple RNN with a ReLU activation and a Dense layer is defined.
Training: The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss, then trained on the generated data.
Prediction: A new sequence is used to test the trained model's ability to predict the next value in the sequence.
2. RNN for Text Sequence Prediction (basic-rnn-text.py)
Overview
This example illustrates the use of an RNN for text sequence prediction, specifically predicting the next word in a given sequence. The model is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras, utilizing the Tokenizer for text preprocessing.

Explanation
Text Preprocessing: The text is tokenized using the Tokenizer class, and sequences of integers are generated.
Data Preparation: Input sequences and labels are created for training, where each input sequence represents a sequence of words, and the label is the next word.
Model Architecture: The RNN model includes an embedding layer, a SimpleRNN layer, and a Dense layer with a softmax activation for predicting the next word.
Training: The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical crossentropy loss, then trained on the prepared data.
Prediction: A new sequence is provided as input to test the model's ability to predict the next word in the sequence.
Conclusion
These examples showcase the versatility of Recurrent Neural Networks in handling both numerical and text sequence prediction tasks. The provided explanations serve as a foundation for more complex applications and can be extended and adapted based on specific use cases.
